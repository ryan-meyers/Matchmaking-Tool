# Matchmaking-Tool

This project is the result from a 24-hour hackathon for CodeDay in Austin (Spring 2014).
This project won the "Top Overall" award.

Feel free to use any code that is helpful, but this code is old and was written when I was still in high school so I'm not sure you'll find any.

What the project is:
We implemented a basic matchmaking system in conjunction with the elo rating system.
Our code would pull players from a SQL database we put up for the hackathon and run a simulation of games being played in real-time.
The stats and ratings of all the players were adjusted as such in real-time to showcase the system.
The future uses we planned on using the project for were an easy to implement matchmaking system for game developers among other things.
